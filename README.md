## Purpose of the analysis 

A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
Since there is no known output for what the bank is looking for, I am going to use unsupervised learning. In order to group the cryptocurrencies, I have decided on a clustering algorithm. Also, I’ll use data visualizations to share the findings with the bank.

## Results

From the data provided I found that there are 532 tradable cryptocurrency that can be grouped in 4 classes.
